# noughts-crosses
The Noughts and Crosses game, AKA Tic-Tac-Toe, written as practice for me to learn various new programming languages. I believe that the best way to learn new languages (mainly the differences in syntax and control flow) is to rewrite a program you are familiar with in them. Noughts and crosses is a simple in theory but surprisingly complex game, and is a good introduction project in my opinion to learning a new language with.

Note that the Rust and C versions are the most robust by far, as I was much less skilled when initially learning to code. I have however left the other versions up here as well so that I have a reminder for myself of how my skills have improved over time.

# build & run instructions

## Rust 🦀
If you wish to build and run the game in *Rust*, make sure that you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed, then compile the `main.rs` into a binary with the rust compiler via `rustc main.rs`, and then execute it by running `./main`.

## C 🐚
If you wish to build and run the game in *C*, use your compiler of choice to compile the main.c file into a binary before running it. On MacOS, you can do `gcc main.c`, and then `./a.out` to run it.

## Go 🦫
If you wish to build and run the game in *GO*, make sure you have the language [Go](https://go.dev/) installed and available in your path. Then, download the `main.go` file, navigate to it, and build using `go build main.go`. An executable called `main` will be compiled, and can be run via `./main`.  Alternatively, you can run it without compiling it and instead run `gp run main.go`.

## Python 🐍
If you wish to run the game in *Python*, run it using `python3 main.py`.
