# noughts-crosses
The Noughts and Crosses game, AKA Tic-Tac-Toe, written as practice for me to learn various new programming languages. I believe that the best way to learn new languages (mainly the differences in syntax and control flow) is to rewrite a program you are familiar with in them. Noughts and crosses is a simple in theory but surprisingly complex game, and is a good introduction project in my opinion to learning a new language with.
# build instructions

## go
If you wish to build and run the game in *GO*, make sure you have the language [Go](https://go.dev/) installed and available in your path. Then, download the `main.go` file, navigate to it, and build using `go build main.go`. An executable called `main` will be compiled, and can be run via `./main`.  Alternatively, you can run it without compiling it and instead run `gp run main.go`.

## c
If you wish to build and run the game in *C*, use your compiler of choice to compile the main.c file into a binary before running it. On MacOS, you can do `gcc main.c`, and then `./a.out` to run it.

## Python
If you wish to run the game in *Python*, run it using `python3 main.py`.
