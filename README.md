# noughts-crosses
The Noughts and Crosses game, AKA Tic-Tac-Toe, written as practice for me to learn various new programming languages.
# build instructions
If you wish to build and run the game in *GO*, make sure you have the language [Go](https://go.dev/) installed and available in your path. Then, download the `main.go` file, navigate to it, and build using `go build main.go`. An executable called `main` will be compiled, and can be run via `./main`.  
If you wish to build and run the game in *C*, use your compiler of choice to compile the main.c file into a binary.
